    "##### Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.\n",

    "Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa, and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enable households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other finance services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.\n",

    "The dataset contains demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 33,610 individuals across East Africa. This data was extracted from various Finscope surveys ranging from 2016 to 2018, You are asked to make predictions for each unique id in the test dataset about the likelihood of the person having a bank account."

    "##### For a country like Rwanda obtaining accurate measurements of vegetation is necessary for policy makers to lay out plans to counter climate change and enhance agricultural productivity. In recent years, satellite based imagery was found to be quite effective in obtaining such measurements especially for areas that are very hard to access and cover.\n",
    "An equally important goal, following this, is the ability to forecast vegetation, and one popular feature that researchers use for this purpose is rainfall.\n",
    "In this brief project, I use three datasets, one for the vegetation index, the other for rainfall, and the third for the longitude and latitude positions of all the districts in Rwanda to investigate how to model the relation between rainfall, vegetation, and the correlation between districts and the distances between them. The data provides monthly measurements of rainfall and vegetation between 2000 and 2014."
